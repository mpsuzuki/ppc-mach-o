# ppc-mach-o
============

## What is this?

Apple publishes their assembler, linker and related binary utilities,
but the codes for PowerPC had already been removed around MacOSX 10.7
or later.  As a foundation to make a cross compiler for PowerPC-based
MacOSX on later systems, some legacy codes are collected in here.

## What this is NOT

This is not trying to port the latest cctools/ld64 to ppc platforms.
This is just trying to compile outdated development tools on later
systems that the official development tools for ppc are unavailable.
